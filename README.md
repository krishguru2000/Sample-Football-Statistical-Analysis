# Sample-Football-Statistical-Analysis
Using stats from the 2021 season, I explore different ways that I can manipulate the data using the Pandas library in Python

The first thing the program does is ask the user what offensive statistic they woud like to see from 2021: passing, rushing, or recieving. It then prints the statistical table for the category from the NFL website for the user to see. The program utilizes the BeautuifulSoup library to do this and parse through the html.

After providing a sample table for the user, the program shows how stats can be analyzed in it. It gives an example on how the passing category table can be viewed. The program prints out a table for the user that shows who had the most passing touchdowns with the least interceptions.

Another important function of Pandas and statsitcial analysis is combining tables. The user is next asked which tables they want to combine. The combined table is then printed based on yards.

One of the most essential calculations in football to analyze a quarterbacks play is their QBR. The QBR is calculated using 4 formulas. The user is shown how it is calculated and it is added as another column to the passing chart.

Lastly the user is given a chance to filter the quarterback table by a statistic's minimum amount. Filtering is very crucial in seeing the value of specific statistics and how players perfrom with them.

Overall I would like this project to showcase the basic ways in statistics can be manipulated by python. This is only a few tasks the Pandas library can perform and much more can be achieved after this.
